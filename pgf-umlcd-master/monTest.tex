\begin{abstract}
  \texttt{pgf-umlcd} is a LaTeX package for drawing UML Class
  Diagrams. As stated by its name, it is based on a very popular
  graphic package \texttt{PGF/TikZ}. This document presents the usage
  of \texttt{pgf-umlcd} and collects some UML class diagrams as
  examples. \texttt{pgf-umlcd} can be downloaded from
  \href{http://code.google.com/p/pgf-umlcd/}{http://code.google.com/p/pgf-umlcd/}.
